# Work-day-scheduler

## Description

This project is a work day scheduler. The user can write notes and the input will be saved in the local storage and will be display after the user reload the page. The scheduler will change between 3 colors which will depend of the time of the day of the user.

I found very hard to save to local storage the user input, I could make it work but only for the first row. I tried to do it by adding a loop and each but it didn't work.

I will improve the code and make it work after I learned more of local storage.
